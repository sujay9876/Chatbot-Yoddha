Yoddha is a chatbot made for providing people the necessary information about Legal, Tax and Compliance laws. This is a very user friendy app which will make people know brief info about the basic details.
Chatbot :
A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.A chatbot is a type of software that can help customers by automating conversations and interact with them through messaging platforms.
What we used :
-> We used Flutter to develop this app
-> We used dialogflow API
-> we used google cloud key to use in dialogflow in this chat bot
How it is different:
This chatbot is different from others because its user friendly interface gives user a better environment where they can easily get to know about their rights.
The chatbot will redirect them to the website where they can read about the act in detail.
User Interface:
